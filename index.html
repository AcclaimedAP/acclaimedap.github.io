        <h2>My studies</h2>
        <h3>Previous studies</h3>
        <p>I've studied IT related subjects for several years, starting at the age of 14, we were taught things such as making webpages(which I was already capable of at the time, read more below!), but also as years went on, I studied programming in C++ and C#, introductary web development by setting up our own Wordpress website using our on theme. I've also studied computer technology, which revolves about intermediate computer usage such as hardware, and software including but not limited to Linux usage, SSH, etc. Beyond that I have also studied administration of server technology and hardware, both theoretical and practical usage of windows servers and Active Directory. Beyond this I've also done a lot of self-studies within programming and development.</p>
        <h3>Current studies</h3>
        <p>Currently I'm studying to become a Front end developer. I'm a student at Medieinstitutet and love it here! We are gaining deep knowledge about both the fundamentals, such as semmantic HTML, a11y, clean code, etc. but we also learn about currently in-demand tech such as React and Vue, with the tools that is necessary to become a solid employee such as unit testing and integration tests using Cypress and Jest. We also expand beyond just the frontend development with backend using Node.js, creating APIs, using socket.io, and many other things. On top of that our studies also include design studies, as well as how to work agile.</p>
